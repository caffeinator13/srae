In this project we use the multi path routing mechanism that aims to achieve higher reliability and load balancing in WSN.the framework for the project is being developed into Java where the network model is deployed and algorithm is implemented. The network model assumes equal number of sensors in every node and of same type of sensors.  <START:skills> A <END> nd finally congestion detection, congestion notification and multi path rate control based protocol is implemented to experiment the model. in this project, it propose about an efficient scheme to control multi path congestion so that the sink can get priority based throughput for heterogeneous data.it has used packet service ratio for detecting congestion as well as performed hop-by-hop multi path congestion control based on that metric.finally,simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach. .

The network model assumes equal number of sensors in every node and of same type of sensors. And finally congestion detection, congestion notification and multi path rate control based protocol is implemented to experiment the model. in this project, it propose about an efficient scheme to control multi path congestion so that the sink can get priority based throughput for heterogeneous data.it has used packet service ratio for detecting congestion as well as performed hop-by-hop multi path congestion control based on that metric.finally,simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach. .

The Digital imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) standard was created by the National Electrical Manufactures Association (NEMA) to aid the distribution and viewing of medical images, such as CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds. Part 10 of the standard describes a file format for the distribution of images. The MICROEYE maintains DICOM images and their accessibility of the users. Based on the roles of the each user is granted access to particular subset of resources and functionalities of the viewer. MICROEYE is intended to use by Radiologist and Doctors for analysing a patient’s scan results. Basically MICROEYE consists of two modules. The first module deals with authentication of the users and provides a full-featured search screen, which searches the DICOM file system based on a wide range of criterions. The second module deals with image processing and Motion image display of a multi-framed DICOM image. Other features are managing the DICOM image in terms of study, series, adding annotations, measurement tools, and other image processing functions like Zoom, Pan, interactive Magnification, exporting of  <START:skills> JP <END> EG, and importing from many popular image formats. etc.

The network model assumes equal number of sensors in every node and of same type of sensors. And finally congestion detection, congestion notification and multi path rate control based protocol is implemented to experiment the model. in this project, it propose about an efficient scheme to control multi path congestion so that the sink can get priority based throughput for heterogeneous data.it has used packet service ratio for detecting congestion as well as performed hop-by-hop multi path congestion control based on that metric.finally,simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach. .

agEncoder is a coding and dictionary management system where dictionaries are maintained/loaded at a central location and verbatim terms received from various systems are coded. agEncoder refers to an item of data initially entered or loaded into the system, reaction, drug or health condition information, as a verbatim term (VT). agEncoder maps verbatim terms to dictionary terms in a process called classification. It automatically classifies verbatim terms that directly match a dictionary term, and enables user to classify variant or misspelled terms manually using agEncoder Coding Browser. agEncoder leverages auto-learning capability of the system so that future occurrences of the same verbatim term are automatically classified the same way as was done earlier. agEncoder provides a UI approach to perform impact analysis of MedD <START:skills> R <END> A and Drug Dictionary upgrades and recoding of cases.

Number Portability is a term used when a user changes from one Telecom operator to another without changing is number. Telcordia Number Portability Gateway (NPG) provides a single, operator-based contact point for mobile operators to manage the complex interfaces, message processing, and transaction data associated with number portability requirements. This gateway can help to reduce operator costs related to number portability by contributing to increased flow through of port requests and simplifying management of both internal and external systems interfaces while supporting operator growth across all subscriber segments and number types. There are external system like NE <START:skills> MS <END>  and OSS with which the gateway interacts in order to complete the flow. The number portability solution by Telcordia is used by operators in Pakistan, Mexico, Oman and few other countries.

MICROEYE is web based DICOM image viewing system. The Digital imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) standard was created by the National Electrical Manufactures  <START:skills> A <END> ssociation (NEM <START:skills> A <END> ) to aid the distribution and viewing of medical images, such as CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds. Part 10 of the standard describes a file format for the distribution of images. The MICROEYE maintains DICOM images and their accessibility of the users. Based on the roles of the each user is granted access to particular subset of resources and functionalities of the viewer. MICROEYE is intended to use by Radiologist and Doctors for analysing a patient’s scan results. Basically MICROEYE consists of two modules. The first module deals with authentication of the users and provides a full-featured search screen, which searches the DICOM file system based on a wide range of criterions. The second module deals with image processing and Motion image display of a multi-framed DICOM image. Other features are managing the DICOM image in terms of study, series, adding annotations, measurement tools, and other image processing functions like Zoom, Pan, interactive Magnification, exporting of JPEG, and importing from many popular image formats. etc.

agEncoder is a coding and dictionary management system where dictionaries are maintained/loaded at a central location and verbatim terms received from various systems are coded. agEncoder refers to an item of data initially entered or loaded into the system, reaction, drug or health condition information, as a verbatim term (VT). agEncoder maps verbatim terms to dictionary terms in a process called classification. It automatically classifies verbatim terms that directly match a dictionary term, and enables user to classify variant or misspelled terms manually using agEncoder Coding Browser. agEncoder leverages auto-learning capability of the system so that future occurrences of the same verbatim term are automatically classified the same way as was done earlier. agEncoder provides a UI approach to perform impact analysis of MedDR <START:skills> A <END>  and Drug Dictionary upgrades and recoding of cases.
