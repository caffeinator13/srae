# Smart Recruitment Automation Engine

[![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An attempt to completely automate the Recruitment process. This piece of code successfully gives us the basic contact information, skills, experience etc., from any document (Job Description/CV/Resume) independent of the document format. I would like to implement some deeplearning algo's to take this project to next level. PR's are most welcomed!

## Pre-requisites

Java, Apache Opennlp

## Flow

This src contains two packages:

**1. pacakge dota**

This package contains all the classes required to parse a document(Job Description or CV) and gives the extracted entitites which is done with the help of using 
Apache Tika and Apache Opennlp.

All the resources are added to the resources folder i.e., all the model files(.bin files), text files etc required.

**2. package training**

This package contains all the classes to train a model with different resources we have.

To create a model, we need to have the training data placed in the respective folder. 

All the code is self explanatory and commented wherever necessary. 

Please use the issue feature to report any bug or any other issues. Feel free to [write to me](abhishek.bagati@gmail.com) in case of any doubts.

## Contributions are welcome

As I said already, I would like to implement some deeplearning algo's to take this project to next level. Please feel free to share any ideas and also, you can contribute to automate a lot of stuff.
